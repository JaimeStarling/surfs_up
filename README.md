# Surf's Up

## Overview

To determine if the business, a surfing supply and ice cream shop combination potentially named Surf n' Shake, is sustainable year-round, we analyzed temperature data for the Hawai'ian Island of Oahu in the months of June and December.

## Results

- June has 12 percent more temperature observations than December but also no known holiday closures that might affect when the weather stations collect data. As seen in the figure below, the average high is 75 degrees Fahrenheit, perfect for ice cream consumption. Oahu’s biggest source of tourists is the contiguous [United States](https://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/media/4167/hta-tourism-econ-impact-fact-sheet-december-2019.pdf) (‘The Mainland’) where the [average high](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/national/202107#:~:text=The%20contiguous%20U.S.%20average%20temperature,in%20the%20127%2Dyear%20record) is 75.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the month of July, the most [popular month](https://www.idfa.org/ice-cream-sales-trends#:~:text=Ice%20Cream%20Production&text=July%20is%20the%20busiest%20production,in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202019) for ice cream sales.

- December has a slightly larger spread of temperatures, with a few days of the month dipping under the 60s in Fahrenheit. However, December is the [second busiest tourist month](https://www.hawaii.com/travel-info/best-time-to-visit-hawaii/) in Hawaii, attracting visitors seeking warm beaches and cold desserts.

- The difference in temperatures for June and December show that Oahu has a very reliable climate with very few extreme temperatures throughout the year. Even in December, only six temperature observations were below normal, and those are considered reasonable by Mainland standards!

## Summary

The year-round differences in temperatures are so small that ice cream is predicted to only dip a little in sales during the coldest month on Oahu. Where locals might skip ice cream for warmer foods, tourists will want to treat themselves to the novelty of ice cream in winter. Even on the coldest days of December, while locals will feel cozy displaying their ugly Christmas sweaters at parties, visitors will be enjoying Spring-like conditions, at least in comparison to their home towns on The Mainland, and may be interested in ice cream. 

We also looked at precipitation scores. While it won’t affect surfing too much, it might affect ice cream. June is the driest month, with an average precipitation score of .14, and [December is arguably the wettest month]( https://www.govisithawaii.com/2014/09/30/hawaii-rainfall-chart-by-month-and-island/) with an average precipitation score of .22.

Where temperatures will not affect sales of ice cream to visitors, rain might. However, visitors know, and appreciate, that unless it is a hurricane, the usual rainstorm on Oahu is short and pleasant. Plus, the rainy moments might benefit the shop by bringing in a few extra customers from the beach wanting temporary shelter. A discount never hurts, along with unique Hawai’ian flavors, to tempt even the locals on what they think is a dreary day on Oahu. 

Mahalo!
